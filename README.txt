Description: 
Bullet Hell "Danmaku" game using openTK and C# which incorporates time manipulation and rhythm aspects. Plans to include
a time limit system to determine game over instead of the conventional 3 lives system. The game will feature
customizable ships and special abilities allowing for time manipulation abilities such as time dilation, time
slowdown and time stop.
